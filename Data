The data was collected by the Seattle Police Department and Accident Traffic Records Department from 2004 to present.
The data consists of 37 independent variables and 194,673 rows. The dependent variable, “SEVERITYCODE”, contains numbers that correspond to different levels of severity caused by an accident from 0 to 4.
Severity codes are as follows:
0: Little to no Probability (Clear Conditions)
1: Very Low Probability — Chance or Property Damage
2: Low Probability — Chance of Injury
3: Mild Probability — Chance of Serious Injury
4: High Probability — Chance of Fatality
Furthermore, because of the existence of null values in some records, the data needs to be preprocessed before any further processing.
